# Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge

## Problem Statement 3: Skill Development
### The Challenge
The Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge is an open initiative to encourage building innovative solutions to solve mobility issues. In the March 2023 edition of the open challenge, there are 10 challenges across 3 tracks: Future of Mobility, Driver Enablement, and Namma Yatri. The Problem Statement 3 is related to Driver Enablement and focuses on identifying ways to digitally enable drivers, so that they can earn on par with fellow drivers.

### The Problem
Drivers come from all ages, and it is generally evident that drivers who are not millennials are not very technologically savvy. Despite the advances in technology, the apps and features cannot create value unless they are widely adopted by the drivers. The challenge is to identify solutions to overcome the following problems:

● Driver's resistance to change.

● Language barriers.

● Unviable business models.

● Unengaging content/training.

● Lack of accountability and monitoring systems.


## The Goal
The goal of this challenge is to find innovative solutions to digitally enable drivers and make them technologically savvy. The solutions should be focused on creating engaging and user-friendly content/training that is easily accessible and understandable to drivers of all ages and backgrounds. The solutions should also address the language barriers and make the training available in multiple languages. Additionally, the solutions should focus on creating viable business models and incorporate accountability and monitoring systems to ensure that the drivers are able to earn on par with their fellow drivers.


## Solution
The solution for the problem statement involved identifying and addressing the challenges faced by drivers who are not technologically savvy. The project proposes the development of a user-friendly app that can help drivers access the required information and training easily. The app can include features like language support, engaging content, and monitoring systems to ensure that drivers can learn and earn better.
