## Driver Empowerment-Skill Development Case Study

## Problem Statement:

Drivers come from all ages. It is generally evident that drivers who are not millennials
are not very technologically savvy. Despite the advances in technology, the apps and features cannot create
value unless they are widely adopted by the drivers. Identify ways to digitally enable drivers, so that they
can earn on par with fellow drivers.

● Driver's resistance to change.

● Language barriers.

● Unviable business models.

● Unengaging content/training.

● Lack of accountability and monitoring systems.
