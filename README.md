# Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge

## Problem Statement 3: Skill Development
### The Challenge
The Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge is an open initiative to encourage building innovative solutions to solve mobility issues. In the March 2023 edition of the open challenge, there are 10 challenges across 3 tracks: Future of Mobility, Driver Enablement, and Namma Yatri. The Problem Statement 3 is related to Driver Enablement and focuses on identifying ways to digitally enable drivers, so that they can earn on par with fellow drivers.

### The Problem
Drivers come from all ages, and it is generally evident that drivers who are not millennials are not very technologically savvy. Despite the advances in technology, the apps and features cannot create value unless they are widely adopted by the drivers. The challenge is to identify solutions to overcome the following problems:

● Driver's resistance to change.

● Language barriers.

● Unviable business models.

● Unengaging content/training.

● Lack of accountability and monitoring systems.

## Solution
The solution for the problem statement involved identifying and addressing the challenges faced by drivers who are not technologically savvy. The project proposes the development of a user-friendly app that can help drivers access the required information and training easily. The app can include features like language support, engaging content, and monitoring systems to ensure that drivers can learn and earn better.
